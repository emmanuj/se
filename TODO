This file lists potential improvements for future versions of se.

Documentation:

	- tutorial (like vimtutor or `C-h t` in emacs)
	- texinfo manual

Port to the following operating systems:

	- FreeDOS 
		(this is a high cost, low reward target, but it might be
		an interesting platform to support).

Other Improvements:

	- Better usage() output with useful explainations.
	- add a test suite (should be easy since we have scriptse already).
