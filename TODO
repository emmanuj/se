This file lists *potential* improvements for future versions of se.

Documentation:

	- tutorial (like vimtutor or `C-h t` in emacs)

	- manual (look at texinfo, asciidoc, docbook, ...)

	- Y2K statement

Port to the following operating systems:

	- ReactOS / Mingw32

		should be possible for the next release. This
		port mainly involves cutting out some of the
		signal stuff on this platform.

	- FreeDOS

		just setting up a build environment is tricky.
		This is a high cost (in terms of effort), low
		reward target, but it might be an interesting
		platform to support.

	- Others?

		Feel free to suggest other operating systems.
		Let me know, tcort@se-editor.org

Other Improvements:

	- Better usage() output with useful explainations.

	- Use crypt.3 functions instead of crypt.1

	- add a test suite.

	- internationalization.

	- continue to clean up the code

		* use lint, splint, rates, ... static analysis tools
