This file lists *potential* improvements for future versions of se.

Documentation:

	- tutorial (like vimtutor or `C-h t` in emacs)

	- texinfo manual

Port to the following operating systems:

	- ReactOS / Mingw32

		should be possible for the next release. This
		port mainly involves cutting out some of the
		signal stuff on this platform.

	- FreeDOS

		just setting up a build environment is tricky.
		This is a high cost (in terms of effort), low
		reward target, but it might be an interesting
		platform to support.

	- Others?

		Feel free to suggest other operating systems.
		Let me know, tcort@se-editor.org

Work on Old Bugs:

	- better tab handling

		* it's hard to get it so that tabs are displayed as
		tabs on the screen and saved to a file as \t characters.

		* a lot of toggling can happen based on how the file is
		opened (cmdline vs in editor), the file name, the .serc,
		the command line arguments, etc. This makes it hard to
		get consistent results. Some options should be set/unset
		rather than toggled.

	- off by 1 error with the help system.

		To Reproduce:
		# start se
		help
		o-
		a
		# apd> opens at line 2 not 1

Other Improvements:

	- Better usage() output with useful explainations.

	- add a test suite.

	- internationalization
