2013.03.24 - se 3.0.1 has been released. This is a security release. It is 
		recommended that all users upgrade. The release fixes 
		insecure handling of .serc files. The new behaviour is 
		to ignore .serc files that aren't owned by the euid of 
		the se process and .serc files that are writable by 
		other users. No other changes are included in this 
		release. Thank you to Matthias Kilian of the OpenBSD 
		project for alerting me to this issue.

2013.03.06 - se 3.0 has been released. This release includes major portability
		enhancements and build system changes. The old makefile based
		build system has been replaced with a slick new autotools
		configure script. This, combined with some code modernization,
		allows se to build and run on a variety of platforms. See the
		ChangeLog for details.
