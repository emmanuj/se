 * Version 3.0.1 released.
 * Security Fix: be more careful with the handling of .serc files. Now the
   euid of se must match the owner of the file and the file must not be
   writable by any other users in order for se to execute it. Thank you 
   to Matthias Kilian of the OpenBSD project for alerting me to this issue.

 * Add support for termios, make termio the fallback.
 * Drop HARD_TERMS, OLD_SCRATCH, and OLD_GLOB options.
